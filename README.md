A little bit about myself

Hello, my name is Nathan, I am 18 years old, Brazilian, and I live in São José do Rio Preto, in the countryside of São Paulo. I am currently still a high school student, more specifically in the third year.

I am a young man passionate about hardware and software, like many on this site. My passion for electronics started with a simple desire to build my own gamer pc (although it is very difficult to build a gamer pc in Brazil).

Currently, I am attending my school (high school and technical school), where I am learning about IT, databases, and programming. These courses have been divided as follows, first year we learn about IT (middle level course), second year we learn about databases (middle level course) and the third year we learn about programming (middle level course). Later this year I am venturing into the world of UX, UI and React.
